Bicycles are one of the world's most popular modes of transportation, 
with some 800 million bicycles outnumbering cars by two to one. 
Bicycles are also the most energy-efficient vehicle—a cyclist burns about 
35 calories per mile (22 calories per km), while an automobile 
burns 1,860 calories per mile (1,156 calories per km). 
Bicycles are used not only for transportation, but for fitness, 
competition, and touring as well. They come in myriad shapes and styles, 
including racing bikes, all-terrain bikes, and stationary bicycles, as well as unicycles, 
tricycles, and tandems.

Ireland has put aside its economic travails to celebrate the day of its national saint, 
St Patrick. This year the celebrations are also global. 70 monuments like the Pyramids and 
Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue have been lit up green.Back home, the streets of Dublin were 
a sea of green as young and old turned out to mark the occasion. It’s been a five day affair, 
with 8,000 visitors from around the world joining in a people's parade.Prime Minister Enda Kenny 
has taken 19 of his ministers on a goodwill trip to sell the Irish brand abroad.More than 13 million 
pints of Guinness will be drunk in the world across one day and Guinness is offering a free visit to 
its factory for everyone called Patrick.

Spam is a growing problem; it interferes with valid email and burdens both email users and service providers. 
In this work, we propose a reactive spam-filtering system based on reporter reputation for use in conjunction 
with existing spam-filtering techniques. The system has a trust-maintenance component for users, based on their 
spam-reporting behavior. The challenge that we consider is that of maintaining a reliable system, not vulnerable 
to malicious users, that will provide early spamcampaign detection to reduce the costs incurred by users and systems. 
We report on the utility of a reputation system for spam filtering that makes use of the feedback of trustworthy users. 
We evaluate our proposed framework, using actual complaint feedback from a large population of users, and validate its 
spam-filtering performance on a collection of real email traffic over several weeks. To test the broader implication 
of the system, we create a model of the behavior of malicious reporters, and we simulate the system under various 
assumptions using a synthetic dataset.

Language sets people apart from all other creatures. Every known human society has had a language 
and though some nonhumans may be able to communicate with one another in fairly complex ways, none 
of their communication systems begins to approach language in its ability to convey information. 
Nor is the transmission of complex and varied information such an integral part of the everyday lives of other creatures. 
Nor do other communication systems share many of the design features of human language, such as the ability 
to communicate about events other than in the here and now. But it is difficult to conceive of a human society without a language.
Language, like culture, that other most human attribute, is notable for its unity in diversity: there are many languages and many 
cultures, all different but all fundamentally the same, because there is one human nature and because a fundamental property of 
this human nature is the way in which it allows such diversity in both language and culture.

Three International Space Station crew have returned to Earth safely. 
The Russian Soyuz capsule carrying them landed in Kazakhstan a day later 
than planned due to poor weather conditions.The Russo-American trio Kevin Ford, 
Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin had spent 144 days aboard the space station and 
clocked up about 61 million miles in space. The crew's descent took just under four hours. 
NASA reported that the deorbit burn had gone flawlessly, with the capsule landing upright 
almost hitting the bulls-eye landing spot through thick fog. The crew are said to be doing 
well and will be transported to a post-flight rehabilitation centre.

Banana, fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae, one of the most important food crops of the world. 
The banana is consumed extensively throughout the tropics, where it is grown, and is also valued in the temperate zone for its flavour, 
nutritional value, and availability throughout the year. The plant is a gigantic herb that springs from an underground stem, or rhizome, 
to form a false trunk 3–6 metres (10–20 feet) high.

Consumer search on the Internet is rarely random. 
Sponsored links appear higher up a webpage and consumers often click them. 
Firms also bid aggressively for these prominent positions at the top of the page. 
But why should prominence matter, when visiting an additional website is almost costless? 
I present a model in which consumers know their valuations for the products offered 
in the market but do not know which retailer sells which product. 
I show that a prominent retailer earns significantly more profit than other firms, 
even when the cost of searching websites and comparing products is essentially zero.

 Can Prominence Matter even in an Almost Frictionless Market?

Reinforcement learning (RL) is learning by interacting with an environment.
An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions, 
rather than from being explicitly taught and it selects its actions on basis 
of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration), 
which is essentially trial and error learning. The reinforcement signal that 
the RL-agent receives is a numerical reward, which encodes the success of an action's outcome, 
and the agent seeks to learn to select actions that maximize the accumulated reward over time. 
(The use of the term reward is used here in a neutral fashion and does not imply any pleasure, 
hedonic impact or other psychological interpretations.)
